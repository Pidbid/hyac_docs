# Architecture

Hyac is built on a modern, container-based architecture. It's designed to be scalable, resilient, and easy to maintain.

## Components

### Web UI

The Web UI is a single-page application built with Vue 3 and Naive UI. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing applications, functions, and other resources.

### Server API

The Server API is the core of the Hyac platform. It's a FastAPI application that provides a RESTful API for managing resources. It's responsible for:

- Authenticating users
- Managing applications and functions
- Interacting with the database and object storage
- Managing the lifecycle of FaaS containers

### Database

Hyac uses MongoDB to store metadata about applications, functions, and other resources.

### Object Storage

Hyac uses MinIO to store function code, dependencies, and other files.

### Docker Manager

The Docker Manager is responsible for managing the lifecycle of FaaS containers. It uses the Docker API to create, start, stop, and remove containers.

### FaaS Container

A FaaS Container is a Docker container that runs a single FaaS application. It's responsible for executing functions and managing dependencies.
